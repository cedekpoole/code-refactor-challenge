# Code Refactor Challenge

## Description

This is an 'on-the-job ticket' or 'feature request' challenge where the main task was to refactor existing code. To refactor code is to improve it without changing the way the code functions (for more on refactoring, see here:...). The goal was to improve accessibility through the incorporation of semantic HTML and the reworking of the CSS to follow the semantic structure of these elements. The CSS selectors have been consolidated to increase efficiency and comments have been made to help any future developer know what each section is for.

## Usage

If you open up the static webpage via GitHub Pages (link: https://cedekpoole.github.io/code-refactor-challenge/), you can inspect the elements within the page (Command + Option + C for Mac, Control + Shift + C for Windows/Linux). Through the inspect tool, you can view how semantic HTML has been incorporated into the webpage, in addition to seeing how the CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organised to follow the semantic structure. You will also notice that all image elements contain accessible alt attributes - this is another key component to the refactoring process.

## Roadmap 

This project is open to any ideas that would improve the accessibility of the webpage. Therefore, there may be updates further down the line if there is a way to make the HTML and CSS more accessible and organised.
